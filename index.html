                    Hi, I'm Chase. I am a full-stack software developer and problem solver. After
                    serving almost five years in the military, I knew that I wanted a career that
                    was going to challenge my mind. I've been intrigued by computers ever since
                    my parents brought one home in the 90s. So As my enlistment started to come to an
                    end I decided to look into programming, and I was hooked. I spent a year and a
                    half at Kennesaw State University pursuing a Computer Science Degree, but
                    ultimately was unsatisfied with the education I was receiving. I did some
                    research and decided to attend Nashville Software School's full-time web development
                    bootcamp, and it was a great decision as they gave me the skills needed to
                    hit the ground running. Following graduation, I was offered a teaching assistant
                    contract with the school. It was very rewarding to help guide a cohort through
                    a three month Python / Django back-end course, many of whom are working as software
                    developers now. I then worked a short software development contract with a
                    start-up in California which was mainly focused on web scraping. I believe my experience
                    has helped me become a well rounded person, and I am eager to help
                    businesses succeed through quality software.

                    SupplyMate is an inventory and logistics management system. It was
                    designed for any company that maintains an inventory and has remote
                    employees that pull from that inventory regularly. This was built
                    with a React front-end and a Django REST Framework API with a SQLite
                    database.

                    It was designed as a responsive web app so users could easily access
                    their workout plans from their phone. A user can also record their
                    workout results and view graphs of their performance over a selected
                    time period. This app was built with React and uses JSON-Server as a
                    pseudo REST API to persist data.
